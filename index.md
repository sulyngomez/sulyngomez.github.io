I am a Principal Researcher at DPR Construction, where I work with the Quality National Team to foster better team dynamics and integrate psychological safety into construction practices. My research focuses on creating environments where teams can thrive through trust, collaboration, and continuous improvement. With a strong foundation in Lean Construction principles, I aim to bridge the gap between people-focused practices and project success. I believe that when we feel safe, we unlock our full potential, leading to stronger teams, better outcomes, and a more resilient construction industry.

In collaboration with the [Respect for People Taskforce][RPT]{:target="_blank"} of the [Lean Construction Institute][LCI]{:target="_blank"}, I am leading research to understand and foster psychological safety across the construction industry.

### Research

My work focuses on understanding and improving how teams work together, with a special emphasis on psychological safety and team behavioral dynamics. Inspired on the research led by Harvad Professor Amy Edmondson, I explore how we can create psychologically safe environment through deliberate planning, and how this in turn, can unlock the full potential of teams.
